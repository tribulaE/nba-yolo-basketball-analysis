# AI/ML NBA Basketball Analysis System (WIP)

This project builds an AI/ML basketball analysis pipeline using YOLO, OpenCV, PyTorch and Python.

## Overview
It takes broadcast footage and uses AI to track players, identify teams by jersey color, track the ball, and map player movements onto a 2D tactical board to calculate speed and distance run

## Planned Features
- Player and ball detection using YOLO  
- Multi-object tracking across frames  
- Custom object detector training  
- Team assignment using zero-shot image classification (Hugging Face)  
- Court keypoint detection  
- Perspective transformation (pixels → meters)  
- Player speed and distance calculations  

## Status
This project is currently under active development and follows a tutorial-based foundation that is being extended and refactored.
