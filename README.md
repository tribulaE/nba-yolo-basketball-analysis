This project builds an AI/ML basketball analysis pipeline using YOLO, OpenCV, PyTorch and Python.

## Overview
It takes broadcast footage and uses AI to track players, identify teams by jersey color, track the ball 

## Planned Features
- Player and ball detection using YOLO  
- Passes and Interceptions also ball control displayed
- Multi-object tracking across frames  
- Custom object detector training  
- Team assignment using zero-shot image classification (Hugging Face)  

## Status
 Complete
